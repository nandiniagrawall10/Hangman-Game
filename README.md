# 🕹️ Hangman Game

Welcome to the Hangman game! This is a Python-based project where you can test your word-guessing skills and have some fun.

## ✨ Features
- **Random Word Selection**: A new word is chosen randomly each time you play.
- **Guessing Mechanism**: Guess one letter at a time to uncover the hidden word.
- **Limited Attempts**: You have a limited number of incorrect guesses before the game ends.
- **Simple Interface**: Text-based interface that's easy to play and enjoy.

## 🎓 Learnings
This project helped in understanding:
- Basic string manipulation in Python.
- Implementing control flow using loops and conditionals.
- Managing user input and output in a console-based application.

## 🛠️ How It Works
- A random word is selected from a predefined list.
- The player guesses one letter at a time.
- Correct guesses reveal the letter's position(s) in the word.
- Incorrect guesses decrease the number of remaining attempts.
- The game ends when the word is fully guessed or the attempts run out.

## 🚀 Getting Started
To play the game, simply run the Python script. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.

```bash
python hangman.py
